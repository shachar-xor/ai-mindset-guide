# AI Usage Quick Start Guide

## The 4 Fundamental Rules

1. **Understand and Manage Context** - AI is good at thinking but bad at managing context. Always ask: "Does the AI have enough context?"

2. **Be Honest** - Be radically honest with the AI about your intentions, concerns, and confusion. But first, be honest with yourself.

3. **Be Lazy** - For everything that takes you time, ask: "Can I get AI to do this instead?" Push the boundaries of delegation.

4. **Take Accountability** - AI is an extension of you. You own everything it produces. Review, validate, and take responsibility without shame.

## The 6 Practical Tips

1. **Help AI Help Himself** - Tell the AI to manage its own long-term memory using files. Remind it to read those files.

2. **Take AI's Perspective** - Put yourself in the AI's position. What context would you need if you were starting fresh?

3. **Train AI to Take Your Perspective** - Train the AI to ask clarifying questions. Tell it: "Make sure you understand before proceeding."

4. **Build Trust with AI** - Start small, verify thoroughly, gradually expand. Progress from trivial → simple → moderate → complex → critical tasks.

5. **Give AI Meaning** - Don't tell it HOW. Tell it WHAT. Better yet, tell it WHY - the purpose, goal, or meaning.

6. **Remember Your Own Meaning** - You have value. If you master AI, you become MORE valuable, not less.

## Key Prompts to Copy-Paste

### For Context Management
```
Before starting, here's the context you need: [explain background, constraints, dependencies]
```

### For Honesty
```
I'm not sure about [X] and I'm concerned about [Y]. Help me understand...
```

### For Long-Term Memory
```
Create a project-notes.md file to track our decisions and architecture. 
Before each task, read it to get context.
```

### For Perspective-Taking (AI → Human)
```
Before you start, make sure you understand what I need. Ask me clarifying questions.
```

### For Accountability
```
I'm submitting this code for review. I've validated it works correctly and understand the implementation.
```

### For Giving Meaning
```
Your objective is to [purpose/goal]. Here's why this matters: [context/impact]
```

### For Building Trust
```
I want you to [task]. I'll review your work carefully. 
Show me your approach first before implementing.
```

## The Progression Framework

**Context:** None → Basic → Detailed → Complete
**Honesty:** Polite → Direct → Vulnerable → Radically honest
**Delegation:** Trivial → Simple → Moderate → Complex → Critical
**Accountability:** Always review and own everything
**Trust:** Verify everything → Verify most → Verify key parts → Verify strategy → Trust with validation

## The Twist

**Almost everything here works with humans too!**

These aren't just "AI rules" - they're principles of effective collaboration, communication, and delegation.

## Quick Diagnostic

**If AI isn't giving you what you need, ask:**

1. ❓ **Context issue?** - Does the AI have all the information it needs?
2. ❓ **Clarity issue?** - Am I being honest about what I really want?
3. ❓ **Scope issue?** - Am I delegating enough, or too much too soon?
4. ❓ **Ownership issue?** - Am I reviewing and validating the output properly?
5. ❓ **Communication issue?** - Did I give the AI meaning/purpose, or just instructions?
6. ❓ **Trust issue?** - Am I at the right level of delegation for my current trust?
