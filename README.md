# AI Usage Rules & Tips: A Human-Centric Guide

## Why This Guide?

Most AI guides teach you **techniques**. This guide teaches you **mindset**.

After working extensively with AI coding assistants (Augment, Claude, GitHub Copilot), I noticed patterns in what works and what doesn't. This guide distills those patterns into a practical framework.

This isn't another prompt engineering tutorial. This is a framework for building an effective working relationship with AI.

## TL;DR - The Framework

### 3 Rules (The Foundation)

1. **Understand and Manage Context** - AI is good at thinking but bad at context. You're good at both. This is THE bottleneck.
2. **Be Honest** - Radically honest. Share confusion, feelings, uncertainties. Don't let ego get in the way.
3. **Be Lazy** - Delegate everything you can. Push boundaries. Let AI do the heavy lifting.

### 6 Tips (The Practice)

1. **Help AI Help Himself** - Teach AI to manage its own context
2. **Use Empathy: Human→AI** - Make it easy for AI to help you
3. **Use Empathy: AI→Human** - Train AI to ask clarifying questions
4. **Build Trust with AI** - Start small, gradually increase complexity
5. **Give AI Meaning** - Share the WHY, not just the WHAT
6. **Remember Your Own Meaning** - You're learning to work with the future, not being replaced

## What Makes This Different?

| Other Guides | This Guide |
|--------------|------------|
| Focus on **techniques** | Focus on **mindset** |
| "Here's how to prompt" | "Here's how to think" |
| Tool-specific tactics | Universal principles |
| AI as a tool | AI as a collaborator |
| Don't trust blindly | Build trust systematically |

**The Result:** You'll understand *why* things work, not just *what* to do.

## Who Is This For?

- **Software engineers** working with AI coding assistants
- **Anyone** who wants to work more effectively with AI
- **Teams** looking to establish AI usage best practices
- **People** who feel overwhelmed or anxious about AI

If you've ever felt:
- "I don't know what to tell the AI"
- "The AI doesn't understand what I want"
- "I'm not sure if I can trust this code"
- "Am I becoming dependent on AI?"

...this guide is for you.

## The Philosophy

### Context is Everything

> "Humans are good at thinking AND context. AI is good at thinking but bad at context."

This single insight explains most AI failures. Once you understand this, everything else makes sense.

### The Twist

Here's something interesting: Almost every rule and tip in this guide applies to working with humans too.

- Manage context when delegating to junior developers
- Be honest about what you don't understand
- Give people meaning and purpose, not just tasks
- Build trust gradually

Effective collaboration has universal principles, whether you're working with AI or humans.
