# AI Usage Rules & Tips: A Human-Centric Guide

## Why This Guide?

Most AI guides teach you **techniques**. This guide teaches you **mindset**.

After working extensively with AI coding assistants (Augment, Claude, GitHub Copilot), I noticed patterns in what works and what doesn't. This guide distills those patterns into a practical framework.

This isn't another prompt engineering tutorial. This is a framework for building an effective working relationship with AI.

## What Makes This Different?

| Other Guides | This Guide |
|--------------|------------|
| Focus on **techniques** | Focus on **mindset** |
| "Here's how to prompt" | "Here's how to think" |
| Tool-specific tactics | Universal principles |
| AI as a tool | AI as a collaborator |
| Don't trust blindly | Build trust systematically |

**The Result:** You'll understand *why* things work, not just *what* to do.

## Who Is This For?

**Primary audience:**
- Software engineers working with AI coding assistants
- Developers who've used AI but want a systematic approach

**Also valuable for:**
- Anyone who wants to work more effectively with AI
- Teams establishing AI usage best practices
- People who feel overwhelmed or anxious about AI

If you've ever felt:
- "I don't know what to tell the AI"
- "The AI doesn't understand what I want"
- "I'm not sure if I can trust this code"
- "Am I becoming dependent on AI?"

...this guide is for you.

## TL;DR - The Framework

### 4 Rules (The Foundation)

1. **Understand and Manage Context** - Context is the primary bottleneck in AI collaboration
2. **Be Honest** - Share confusion, feelings, uncertainties without ego
3. **Be Lazy** - Delegate aggressively, push boundaries
4. **Take Accountability** - AI is an extension of you; you own everything it produces

### 6 Tips (The Practice)

1. **Help AI Help Himself** - Teach AI to manage its own context
2. **Take AI's Perspective** - Understand what context AI needs
3. **Train AI to Take Your Perspective** - Teach AI to ask clarifying questions
4. **Build Trust with AI** - Start small, gradually increase complexity
5. **Give AI Meaning** - Share the WHY, not just the WHAT
6. **Remember Your Own Meaning** - You're learning to work with the future, not being replaced

## The Twist

Here's something interesting: Almost every rule and tip in this guide applies to working with humans too.

- Manage context when delegating to junior developers
- Be honest about what you don't understand
- Take accountability for work you delegate
- Give people meaning and purpose, not just tasks
- Build trust gradually

**Effective collaboration has universal principles, whether you're working with AI or humans.**

This isn't just an AI guide—it's a collaboration guide.
